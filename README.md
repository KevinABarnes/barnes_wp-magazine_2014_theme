Barnes WP-Magazine 2014 WordPress Theme

==

This theme is initially based on the _s starter theme (version from 29May2014 10:00 PM CST).

The only major change made to _s before beginning theme development was to flip the #primary and #main DIVs (in _s, the #main DIV sits inside the #primary DIV - I reversed this so that #primary sits inside #main) and then place the sidebar outside #primary DIV, but inside #main DIV.
